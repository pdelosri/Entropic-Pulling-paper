\section*{Abstract}
Hsp70 chaperones sit at the heart of the protein homeostasis network in the cell, protecting  against protein misfolding and aggregation. Furthermore, they are involved in a vast array of housekeeping roles, such as the translocation of proteins in some organelles and the regulation of the assembly state of some functional protein oligomers, such as clathrin cages and Heat-Shock Factor trimers. A general mechanism that has emerged, called \textit{entropic pulling}, proposes that the excluded volume interactions of the chaperones with their substrates and surrounding molecular environment generate forces that drive
the disparate functions of Hsp70s. In this work we evaluate the strength of entropic pulling in various contexts where the action of Hsp70 is known to be determinant, and in various Hsp70 oligomeric states, that have been observed to have roles \textit{in vitro}.
Furthermore, we generalise the same principles to other bulky proteins, epitomised by the antigen binding fragments of antibodies (Fab) and by the Trigger Factor, arguing that entropic pulling represents a general, universal mechanism of force generation does not necessarily rely on any too specific structural underpinning. Last but not least, we propose that the also the Hsp100 chaperones, which are powerful disaggregating machines, might importantly profit from entropic pulling forces.

\section*{Introduction}
Protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is a cellular condition whereby proteins are at the correct concentration in the correct localization and, most importantly, in the correct conformations. Molecular chaperones are central to proteostasis maintenance and in particular the 70 kDalton Heat Shock Protein (Hsp70) is likely the central component of the chaperone network. Hsp70s drive the translocation of nuclear encoded proteins into mitochondria and the \textit{endoplasmic reticulum} (ER), and there is growing evidence that they are similarly responsible for protein import into chloroplasts and lysosomes; they control the assembly state of functional oligomers such as clathrin cages and Heat Shock Factor trimers; they help ribosomes overcome stalling during stresses and, crucially for proteostasis, they can lead to the loss of wrong tertiary and secondary structures in their misfolded or aggregated substrates, allowing them, upon release, to fold back into the native state. All these different actions require Hsp70s to apply on their substrates a  pulling/pushing force. 

The \textit{power stroke} mechanism was one of the first models that had been proposed to explain the ability of Hsp70s to apply a force on their substrates in the context of protein translocation into mitochondria and the ER. The power stroke relies on a chaperone conformational transition, fueled by ATP hydrolysis, that, in the presence of an attachment fulcrum, would result in a lever-arm movement that mechanically pulls the bound polypeptide. As a matter of fact, biochemical assays ruled out the presence of a fulcrum
in protein translocation, and structural analysis of the post-hydrolysis structure of Hsp70 revealed that the chaperone would result in an extremely floppy lever, unable to apply significant forces. The competing model, the \textit{Brownian ratchet}, posited that Hsp70s would translocate polypeptides across pores by latching onto exposed binding sites appearing out of the pores, and forbidding retrotranslocation by simply being larger than the pore hole size. More Hsp70 molecules would then bind to new binding regions emerging from the pore driven by simple diffusion. Thus, by solely relying on the spontaneous fluctuations of the process, the Brownian ratchet is unable to apply forces on the chaperone substrates. Although appealing for its simplicity and for not relying on any special structural feature, the Brownian ratchet cannot explain the role of Hsp70 in contexts where thermal fluctuations are absent (\textit{e.g.} translational stalling) or where the presence of a single binding site excludes the progressive trapping of fluctuations (\textit{e.g.} clathrin cage disassembly).

De Los Rios \textit{et al.} proposed that

was not able to generate forces



In the introduction you will see an example of text wrapping around the figure with a figure caption on the margin (Fig. \ref{fig1}). This is done by combining the \verb!wrapfigure! with % avoid blank space here 
\marginpar{
\vspace{.7cm} % adjust vertical position relative to text with \vspace{} - note that you can enter negative numbers to move margin caption up
\color{Gray} % this gives caption a grey color to set it apart from text body
\textbf{Figure \ref{fig1}. Example of a margin caption.} % note that \ref{fig1} refers to the corresponding wrapfigure
Setting up your figure + caption like this looks fancy and does not disrupt the flow of the text. But it requires more manual adjustments (position, spacing, labeling) compared to using standard \LaTeX figure environments.
}
\begin{wrapfigure}[19]{l}{75mm}
% the number in [] of wrapfigure is optional and gives the number of text lines that should be wrapped around the text. Adjust according to your figures height
\includegraphics[width=75mm]{fig1.pdf}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty} % makes sure dummy caption is blank
\caption{} % add dummy caption - otherwise \label won't work and figure numbering will not count up
\label{fig1} % use \ref{fig1} to reference to this figure
\end{wrapfigure} % avoid blank space here
the \verb!marginnote! environment. Please note that in this case the figure (\verb!wrapfigure!) and the figure caption (\verb!marginpar!) have to be separated as you can tell from the code. The \verb!wrapfigure! environment can be a bit tricky when it comes to text formatting. Thus some general hints: (a) try to avoid line breaks in the code as this may result in weird formatting around the figure, (b) the figure should not span multiple headlines (sections) and (c) if you encounter problems with the line break right after the \verb!wrapfigure! try using \verb!\mbox{}! to prevent premature line breaks (\mbox{see example in code}). As stated in the figure caption, setting up figures this way requires a bit more manual adjustments but it makes figures blend in nicely without interrupting flow of text.

\section*{Materials and Methods}

\subsection*{Tables.} 

In this section you will find an example of a table using the \verb!table! plus the \verb!adjustwidth! environment and should give you a minimal example for tables in \LaTeX (Table \ref{tab1}).

\begin{table}[!ht]
\begin{adjustwidth}{-1.5in}{0in} % comment out/remove adjustwidth environment if table fits in text column.
\centering
\caption{{\bf Example Table.} This table demonstrates how to use the  adjustwidth environment if you need that tad bit of extra width for your figures or tables.}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
\multicolumn{4}{|l|}{\bf Heading 1} & \multicolumn{3}{|l|}{\bf Heading 2}\\ \hline
cell 1 - row 1 & cell 2 - row 1 & cell 3 - row 1 & cell 4 - row 1 & cell 5 - row 1 & cell 6 - row 1 & cell 7 - row 1 \\ \hline
cell 1 - row 2 & cell 2 - row 2 & cell 3 - row 2 & cell 4 - row 2 & cell 5 - row 2 & cell 6 - row 2 & cell 7 - row 2 \\ \hline
cell 1 - row 3 & cell 2 - row 3 & cell 3 - row 3 & cell 4 - row 3 & cell 5 - row 3 & cell 6 - row 3 & cell 7 - row 3 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab1}
\end{adjustwidth}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Paragraph.}
Instead of adding more and more subsections you can use the \verb!\paragraph{}! command to give structure to your manuscript.

\subsection*{Formulas.}
For mathematical formulas you should use the math environment. See this example:

\begin{center}
$f(A_{ik},A_{jk}) = min(A_{ik},A_{jk}) - C_{1} max(A_{ik},A_{jk}) e^{-C_{2}min(A_{ik},A_{jk})}$
\end{center}

% newpage forces a page break if you want to clearly separate materials from results

\section*{Results}
\subsection*{Standard floating figures.}
Figure \ref{fig2} is wrapped into a standard floating environment. That means that \LaTeX will determine the exact placement of the figure. Even though you can state preferences (see code) it can be tricky to get the right placement - especially when working on very tight manuscripts. If you want exact placement, add \verb!\usepackage{float}! to this file's header and use [H] in the figure environment's placement options.


\begin{figure}[ht] %s state preferences regarding figure placement here

\label{fig2} % \label works only AFTER \caption within figure environment

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Page break in figures.}
The standard floating figures in \LaTeX do not cope well with page breaks which can make it difficult to fit in large figures. One way to deal with this is to separate figure and caption but \verb!\caption{}! might still give troubles at page breaks. Figure 3 demonstrates a way to manually set up figure and caption such that it continues onto the next page.
